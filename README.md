Yet Another Custom Script Generator for [Blood on the Clocktower][botc]

With apologies to those in Weird Paper Size Land&trade;, this project currently
creates A4 size PDFs. I haven't tried viewing, printing or scaling to _Letter_.
If there's huge demand I may look into this later.

## Requirements

- `python` 3.11, or newer
- `poetry`
- `make` is strongly recommended, but you can skip it if you know what your doing

## Usage

### Sanity Check

The easiest way to get started is to generate a copy of the Trouble Brewing script:

```sh
make tb
```

Generated files are saved in the [`pdfs/`](pdfs/) directory.

### Single Script

To generate a PDF for a custom script, download the JSON, and use `make
process`. For example:

```sh
make process INPUT_FILE="scripts/No Roles Barred.json"
```

### All Scripts

To generate PDF files for all files in the [`scripts`](scripts/) directory you
can use:

```sh
make all-scripts
```

## Acknowledgements

Clearly I wouldn't be doing any of this without the existence of
[Blood on the Clocktower][botc], or the existence of [custom scripts][botc-scripts].

I always aspire to take something and make it better (for some value of better)
so after seeing the functional PDFs generated from the [script
tool][botc-scripts] and later the beauty of the [No Roles Barred][script-nrb] I
went on a personal quest to try to generate "beautiful" PDFs from the tool's
JSON.

I stumbled across [LectronPusher's generator][botc-generator] and thought, "I
could tweak this, and be done". I soon realised that life is too short to learn
[LaTeX][latex] and after a pause to ruminate I decided to pull the best parts
together and sprinkle some Chisel-magic into the mix.

For better or worse, this project is the result of that desire.

## Desires

- be able to generate something closely resembling the
  [No Roles Barred][script-nrb] style
- be reasonably simple to edit/restyle
- use existing resources for information (`*.json` from other tools)
